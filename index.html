        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Ever since I was 12 years old I wanted to be a developer. My goal is to get people the information they need in a timely manner. Get the right information to the right people at the right time. So that they can make the best decisions possible.</p>
        <p>The ideals that are most important to me are freedom and choice. I am proponent of "libre" software. Privacy is also very important to me because a limitation on privacy also limits your freedom and your ability to choose.</p>
